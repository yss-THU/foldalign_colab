2. CITATION:
============

Sundfeld et al. Sundfeld et al. Bioinformatics 2016, 32(8):1238-1240


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WEBSITE:
===========

http://rth.dk/resources/foldalign

Extra documentation is avilable at the website.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. INSTALLATION:
================

In the FOLDALIGN directory type:
make

This should build the foldalign and locateHits binaries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. FOLDALIGN USAGE SUMMARY:
===========================

bin/foldalign [options] input_files

The input_files are by default assumed to be in fasta format. If one file is
given then all sequences are aligned to all the other sequences in that file.
If two files are given then all sequences in the first file are aligned to all
the sequences in the second file. Files in the tab format (see the format
option) are treated in the same way. When using the pair format only one file
can be read, and only the respective pairs are aligned.

The most important options are
-h or -help          Prints the help text for all options. Including those not
                     described here.

-max_length <number> Set the maximum motif length (lambda) to <number>. This
                     option is vital for memory and time consumption.

-max_diff <number>   Set the maximum length difference (delta) to <number>. This
                     option is vital for memory and time consumption.

-score_matrix <file_name> Change the default score matrix to the one in the file
		     <file_name>. An example of a score matrix is in the file
		     called:
		     scorematrix/scanning.default.fmat
		     The values in this matrix are the same as the default
		     values (The default values are hardcode in the
		     src/scorematrix.cxx file).

-format <type>       Controls the input format. FOLDALIGN can handle four input
                     formats: fasta (one or two fasta files), tab
		     (one or two tab delimited files, format:
		     name\sequence\tnot_used\tcomment), pair (one file only.
		     format: name_1\tseq_1\tname_2\tseq_2\toption1 option2 ...),
		     commandline (two sequences on the commandline).

-plot_score	     Print the best alignment score for each pair of positions
                     in the two sequences. Produces a lot of output.

-global  	     Make global alignments instead of local alignments.

-output_format summary Limits the output to the header, which makes it easier for
                     a human to look at the structures. Be warned that some of
		     the often used information is missing in this output.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SCRIPTS:
===========

locateHits.
  The locateHits finds non-overlapping hits in FOLDALIGN output. It reads from
  standard in or files. FOLDALIGN has to be run with option -plot_score.

  The output from locateHits is:
  Name_of_the_first_sequence Start_position_in_sequence_1
  End_position_in_sequence_1 Name_sequence_2 Start_position_2 End_position_2
  Hit_score P-value Rank

scalematrix.
  This script rescales the single strand and base-pair substitution parts of a
  score matrix. Three pre-clustered but unscaled score-matrices can be found in
  the scorematrix directory. Use option -help to print the script's help text.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. SCORE MATRICES:
==================

Seven score matrices have been included in the scorematrix directory. FOLDALIGN
has a build in score matrix. It is therefore only necessary to change the
parameters which have values different from the defaults. The matrix
scanning.default.fmat contains the default values. There are three matrices
containing all parameters, and which are ready for use:
  
scanning.default.fmat
  Is the default score matrix. This matrix is good for scanning and predicting
  structures without large inserts.
  
structure.fmat
  Is better for structure prediction when there are inserts.
  
global.fmat
  Is a matrix optimize to make global alignments (primarily on tRNAs).
  
To change FOLDALIGN's dependency on sequence similarity it is only necessary to
change the two similarity matrices. Four unscaled Ribosum-Like matrices are
included:

RL0.pus-fmat, RL40.pus-fmat, RL70.pus-fmat, and RL100.pus-fmat. 

These matrices are Ribosum-Like matrices (Partial and UnScaled) with different
levels of clustering. The RL.0.fmat matrix is a no-similarity matrix, and the
RL.100.fmat matrix no clustering has been used. The substitution scores in
these matrices are very high compared to the energy parameters. They can be
scaled down with the scalematrix script.

Extra documentation and examples are available in the documentation part of the
web-site: http://rth.dk/resources/foldalign

8. DIRECTORIES:
===============

  bin          contains the FOLDALIGN program and the scripts.
  data         contains examples of the data formats, and a color.scale file.
  scorematrix  contains examples of score matrices.
  src          contains the source code for FOLDALIGN.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. EXAMPLES:
============

A quick test:

  bin/foldalign -format commandline  AAAAAAAAUUUUU GGGGGGGGGGGGCCCCCCCC

Local structure prediction:

  bin/foldalign -ID "tRNA local alignment" data/tRNA.motif.fasta

Global structure prediction:

  bin/foldalign -global -score_matrix scorematrix/global.fmat -max_diff 15  -format tab -ID "tRNA global alignment" data/tRNA.motif.tab

Scan:

  bin/foldalign -plot_score -max_diff 15 -ID "tRNA scan" -format pair data/tRNA.500.pair | gzip > tRNA.scan.col.gz

  The -max_length and -ID parameters are set in the data file. This alignment
  should take hours to complete.

  The output from a scan can be processed with the locateHits script:

  gunzip -c tRNA.scan.col.gz | bin/locateHits > hitlist
  
Multiple sequences:

  This file contains three sequences in fasta format. This produces three
  alignments.

  bin/foldalign -max_diff 15 -ID "Test sequences" -summary data/random1.fasta

  This alignes the three sequences in the first file to the two sequences in the
  second file.
  
  bin/foldalign -max_diff 15 -ID "Test sequences" -summary data/random1.fasta data/random2.fasta

Rescaling a matrix:

  bin/scalematrix -ss=0 -bp=0.025 scorematrix/RL40.pus-fmat > RL40_0_0.025.fmat
  
  bin/foldalign  -max_diff 15 -score_matrix RL40_0_0.025.fmat -ID "tRNA local alignment" data/tRNA.motif.fasta
